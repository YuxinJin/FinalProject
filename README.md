This repository is for my final project in TRGN510 course. In this file, I will simply introduce my project and describe the major steps to realize it.

# Project: Gene Expression Analysis
## Description
I plan to use the data of lung squamous cell carcinoma patients between 50 years old and 60 years old. And my goal is to compare expression of all genes between male and female patients.

## Major Steps
### Step 1: Data Importing
There are 99 files of data in total. I will import them into two single dataframe. One is the combination of female data and the other is the combination of male data.

I upload two rmd files for data importing.
1. [FemaleDataImport.Rmd](https://github.com/YuxinJin/FinalProject/blob/master/FemaleDataImport.Rmd)- After running this file, you will get a single dataframe with all female data inside.

2. [MaleDataImport.Rmd](https://github.com/YuxinJin/FinalProject/blob/master/MaleDataImport.Rmd)- After running this file, you will get a single dataframe with all male data inside.
